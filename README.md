# Finding Minimum with Gradient Descent Method

This Python script aims to find the minimum point of a mathematical function using the gradient descent method.

## Use

1. Find the minimum point with the gradient descent method by running the `main.py` file in the main directory of the project.

    ```bash
    python main.py

Observe the results by adjusting the initial value (x_value) and learning coefficient (alpha) values as you wish.
